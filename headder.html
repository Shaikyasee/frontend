	<h1>INDIA</h1>
   <h2>ORANGE</h2>
   <h3>WHITE</h3>
   <h4>GREEN</h4>
   
	<p>Till then we should edit the name to Republic of India (Bharat) as In official Indian constitution it's already mentioned two names, one India and other Bharat. There is no doubt in this. It is just that it is not widely used internationally but it's official. I can see an ISO tag but it should be "Republic of India (Bharat)" or "Republic of India or Bharat" as Bharat is not just devnagari translation of India. It is other name. If you want ISO, it should be included after the English "Bharat" which should be placed at level equivalent to name India. Revdevil (talk) 16:04, 5 September 2023</p>

	<p>But Indias name had not changed two years ago. An editor had attempted to interpret the Indian constitution from first principles 70 years after India became a republic. . This has happened once a year in my 17 years. This time it is dinner napkins. Fowler&fowler«Talk» 20:48, 5 September 2023 <br\>
		In other words when a country’s name changes, it is reflected in international protocols, in the way the UN addresses the dignitary of a country, records the various activities of a country. Nothing has happened yet. Only dinner napkins have Bharat printed. Storm in a teacup. Fowler&fowler«Talk» 20:52, 5 September 2023
